EXCEPT FOR SECTION 7.1 HEREOF AND THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, JMI MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY OTHER MATTER WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIAL WHETHER USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES. 7.3 JMI will provide Celgene with the results of all assays required to be run under the Specifications. JMI will ship Material to Celgene in accordance with Articles 6 and 11. Material will be deemed accepted by Celgene upon final release by Celgene's Quality Assurance Department, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the Material sold hereunder; provided, however, in the case of Material having latent defects resulting in a recall of products incorporating such Material, which upon diligent examination in accordance with the quality control testing procedures set out in the Specifications upon receipt could not have been discovered during such period, Celgene shall have the right to revoke its acceptance of such Material no later than at the time Celgene first becomes aware of the latent defect causing such Material to be Defective Material. Celgene, after becoming aware of such, shall promptly notify JMI in writing if the Material is Defective Material or is subject to any claim of damage in shipment or shortage. In the event the Material is Defective Material, or is subject to any claim of damage in shipment or shortage, the rejected Material shall not be used by Celgene and the entire shipment shall promptly be returned by Celgene to JMI at JMI's expense, or such other mutually agreed upon response shall be undertaken. JMI shall have the right, but not the obligation, to retest the rejected Material in accordance with Exhibit B. In the event that JMI disputes Celgene's determination that Material is Defective Material or has been damaged or is subject to a shortage in quantity, the parties shall meet to resolve, in good faith, such dispute. In the event that JMI disputes Celgene's determination of Defective Material and the parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the parties shall promptly name an independent and mutually acceptable laboratory (the "Laboratory") that has been qualified for the appropriate testing method(s). The Laboratory shall test the Material in accordance with the Specifications, and such test results obtained by the Laboratory shall be final and controlling. 6 7.4 Upon return of any rejected Material, and JMI's agreement, or a final determination in accordance with this Agreement, that such Material is Defective Material or has been damaged, JMI will replace the Material at JMI's cost and will resubmit to Celgene within sixty (60) days of receipt of additional raw materials from Celgene and JMI's other suppliers.

In the event that JMI fails to replace the Material or fails to do so within the time period stated, Celgene shall have the right to demand a credit of the purchase price therefor. Subject to Section 7.7, JMI shall not be liable for, and Celgene assumes responsibility for, all injuries or damages to any person or property resulting from the handling, possession, or use of the Material following Celgene's receipt of the Material. 7.5 IN NO EVENT SHALL JMI BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER CELGENE'S CLAIM FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY IS IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT IN ANY RESPECT WHATSOEVER LIMIT JMI'S LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 7.7. Except to the extent otherwise provided under Section 7.7, Celgene agrees to indemnify and hold harmless JMI from all losses, liability, damages, and/or expenses which may be sustained or claimed against JMI arising out of the handling, possession, or use of the Material, following Celgene's receipt of the Material. 7.6 Celgene assumes and will bear the expenses of, and will hold JMI harmless against, any loss, suit, claim or damage arising from or out of any intellectual property liability for Material manufactured to Celgene's Specifications or by the Manufacturing Procedure provided by Celgene, including, without limitation, for actual or alleged infringement of any U.S. or foreign patents because of use of Material or such Manufacturing Procedure, including, without limitation, manufacturing Material with and use of Resolving Agent.

JMI shall have the right to defend and/or settle any such claim and Celgene shall give JMI such information and assistance as may be reasonably necessary in the conduct of such defense. Celgene shall have a right to participate in such defense at its cost. 8. FORCE MAJEURE 8.1 Original agreed upon times are not to be deemed of the essence of an accepted order and reasonable variations from originally agreed upon times will be accepted by Celgene. JMI's obligations to process and Celgene's obligations to take, Material shall be subject to any delays caused by acts of God, fires, floods, explosion, sabotage, riot, accidents; orders of, or failure to issue or continue in effect all necessary permits by, civil or military authorities whether relating to manufacture and sale of the Material, or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise; delays by suppliers of fuel, power, raw materials (including Resolving Agent), containers or transportation; breakage or failure of machines, strikes, lockouts or labor trouble; perils of the sea; or any other cause beyond such party's reasonable control; provided that no event of force majeure shall excuse Celgene from taking and paying for Material that JMI has made or that is in the process of being made and is subject to a firm order therefor. 8.2 The party invoking this Article 8 shall give the other party prompt written notice of any event that is likely to delay shipment or acceptance. No such delay shall result in cancellation of quantities required hereunder, or of this Agreement, provided that either party may cancel or amend the quantities delayed wihout penalty if any delay lasts longer than ninety (90) days. 8.3 If for any reason JMI is unable or unwilling to supply such quantity and/or quality of Material to Celgene as contemplated hereunder, Celgene shall have the right to qualify an alternate source of Material and purchase such quantity of Material from such source, without further obligation to JMI hereunder with respect to such Material that JMI does not supply; provided, however, that upon written notice by JMI that JMI is able to resume the supply of Material, Celgene shall resume its purchasing from JMI; provided further, however, that Celgene may not invoke the provisions of this Article 8 due to its inability to supply Resolving Agent to JMI if Celgene is able to supply Resolving Agent to any third party. 8 9. GROSS INEQUITIES 9.1 It is the further intent of the parties hereto that they shall mutually benefit from the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, and in the event that either party shall suffer a gross inequity resulting from such terms, conditions or provisions, or from a substantial change in circumstances or conditions, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve or remove such inequity. It is mutually understood and agreed, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to relieve either party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, unless and until such changes have been agreed to in writing by both parties. 10. PAYMENT 10.1 Celgene will remit payment in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. Celgene agrees to pay an interest charge equal to one and onehalf percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance on any invoice. 10.2 Price Charges The price of Material shall be automatically subject to price escalation on the first day of each calendar year beginning with January 1, 2002, by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the producer price index ("PPI"). The PPI referenced herein shall be determined from Table VI of the Producer Prices and Price Index, commodity code 063 for drugs and pharmaceuticals, Bureau of Labor Statistics (or if discontinued such equivalent index as is mutually agreed to by the parties). The percentage change in the PPI shall be determined by dividing the final annual average PPI for the immediately preceding calendar year by the final annual average PPI for the next preceding calendar year. For example, the price increase effective January 1, in year X would be determined under the above formula by dividing the final annual average from calendar year X1 by the final annual average PPI from calendar year X2. If such percentage change is less than zero percent (0.00%), the prices shall remain unchanged. 10.3 Any present or future duty, sales, use, excise or other taxes other than taxes on income, whether Federal, State or local, applicable to this transaction are not included in the price herein stated and when due shall be paid by Celgene without cost or charge to JMI. 11. DEA AND HAZARDS REQUIREMENTS 11.1 The Material is scheduled under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. JMI is required to obtain a quota from the DEA before producing Material. DEA quotas are limited, therefore, in order to assure Celgene of the supplies agreed to hereunder, JMI agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain DEA manufacturing quota and Celgene shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with JMI's request for manufacturing quota and obtain DEA procurement quota sufficient to allow JMI to process Celgene orders for Material. 9 11.2 Each party's obligation hereunder is subject to obtaining the necessary DEA quota. Neither party shall be liable to the other for that quantity of Material which the other party is unable to supply or take as a result of failure to obtain the necessary DEA quota so long as it has used reasonable best efforts to obtain sufficient DEA quota. 11.3 Each party shall use its best efforts consistent with reasonable business practices and its obligations under this Agreement to inform the other party of any hazards or precautions which need to be taken, of which the party is or becomes aware, with respect to the manufacture or handling of Material and Resolving Agent and the use of Manufacturing Procedure during every phase under this Agreement. 12. EARLY TERMINATION 12.1 In addition to termination as provided for in Article 2, this Agreement can be terminated by JMI for nonpayment of any sums due hereunder (remaining unpaid for more than thirty (30) days after notice to Celgene), or by either party at any time with 90 days' advance written notice: (i) on account of a material violation of the Agreement by the other party, provided, however, that such notice shall be null and void if the offending party cures the violation before expiration of the ninety (90) days notice period; or (ii) when the other party makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, has a custodian, receiver or any trustee appointed for it or a substantial part of its assets, commences any voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy law; or (iii) when a court having jurisdiction over the other party shall enter a decree or order for relief in any involuntary case under applicable bankruptcy law and such decree or order shall continue unstayed and in effect for a period of sixty (60) days or more; or (iv) product withdrawal by Celgene, FDA or DEA. 12.2 Termination for any reason by either party under this Article 12 shall not prejudice that party's remaining contractual rights hereunder, including without limitation rights to direct damages, nor terminate obligations set forth in Articles 7 and 17 hereof. 13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT 13.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.
