WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, WWI and CoPacker entered into a CoPack Agreement, dated November 30, 1999 (the "Existing Agreement"), and the parties desire to modify certain of the terms of their business agreement and wish to do so by canceling the Existing Agreement and substituting in its place this Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; and WHEREAS, WWI desires to obtain a supply of bar and drink mix products as more fully described in Exhibit A, which is attached to and made a part of this Agreement, (the "Products") for distribution and sale by WWI under the terms of this Agreement and CoPacker desires to supply the Products to WWI under the terms of this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises that this Agreement contains, and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which the parties acknowledge, the parties, intending to be bound legally, agree as follows: 1. MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT. WWI shall place purchase orders with CoPacker, and CoPacker shall sell and deliver to WWI, quantities of the Products under the terms of this Agreement. CoPacker shall manufacture and package the Products in strict compliance with the standards and specifications attached as Exhibit B and made a part of this Agreement (the "Specifications"). All purchases of the Products by WWI under this Agreement shall be pursuant to, and under the terms and conditions of, a duly authorized and issued WWI purchase order, the form of which is attached as Exhibit C and made a part of this Agreement. In addition, CoPacker shall comply with the provisions of the WWI CoPack Manual for the Products attached as Exhibit D and made a part of this Agreement, as WWI may reissue or amend from time to time (the "CoPack Manual"). The terms and conditions of the WWI purchase order form and the CoPack Manual shall be in addition to and not in limitation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any inconsistencies between the terms and conditions of the WWI purchase order form or the CoPack Manual and this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any inconsistencies between the terms and conditions of the WWI purchase order form and the provisions of the CoPack Manual shall be resolved in favor of the provisions of the CoPack Manual. Any terms or conditions appearing on or incorporated into any invoice forms or other documents sent by CoPacker which are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not apply. 2. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until December 31, 2004 (the "Term"). This Agreement may, at the option of WWI, be renewed for an additional one (1) year period, and successive one (1) year periods thereafter, by providing written notice to CoPacker of such election to renew at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to expiration of the Term or any renewal term thereof. 3. PRODUCTION SCHEDULE. Both parties understand and acknowledge that the quantity and variety of the Products ordered by WWI will be derived from marketing projections that may not necessarily depict actual sales volume since the Products represent a new entry by WWI into the bar market; therefore, the total quantity of Product to be purchased hereunder is subject to wide fluctuation. On or before the beginning of each month during the Term or any renewal term, WWI shall also furnish CoPacker with an estimate of the quantities of the Products it will require in the succeeding threemonth period. These estimates shall not be binding or otherwise limit or obligate WWI in its order of Products under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, WWI shall not be required to purchase any minimum quantity of the Products. 4. LEAD TIME. CoPacker understands and acknowledges that, because of the competitive nature of the market for the Products, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE of this Agreement. CoPacker shall manufacture and shall ship all quantities of the Products for delivery as specified in a duly authorized purchase order that WWI has issued pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement. CoPacker shall manufacture and have ready for shipment sufficient Products to fill WWI's purchase orders with thirty (30) days from the date each purchase order is received by CoPacker. 5. MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. CoPacker shall manufacture the Products at its processing facilities at Irwindale and Los Angeles, California or at such other facility as WWI and CoPacker shall mutually agree (the "Factory"). CoPacker warrants that the Factory is capable of manufacturing and processing the Products in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and that CoPacker now solely leases and operates, and for the term of this Agreement solely shall lease and operate, the Factory and all processing equipment located in the Factory. Copacker shall be the exclusive supplier of the Products within the continental United States of America during the term of this Agreement. 6. RAW MATERIALS; INGREDIENTS; PACKAGING. CoPacker shall furnish all raw materials and ingredients required for the manufacture, production, and processing of the Products and shall supply all nutrition bar wraps, four pack cartons, and cases necessary for packaging of the Products under this Agreement.

WWI shall have the right from time to time at its sole option to modify the formulations for the Products included as part of the Specifications. The prices for Products with modified formulations shall be adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties hereto to reflect any increased or decreased cost of manufacture by CoPacker. WWI shall also have the right from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the parties hereto to require modifications or alterations in the processing techniques utilized to manufacture the Products. The prices shall be adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties hereto to reflect any increased or decreased costs as a result of such modifications or alterations, including but not limited to any increased or decreased fixed costs from changes in or additions to equipment required thereby. 8. COMPENSATION.

One Hundred Eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the initial term of this Agreement and any renewal terms thereafter, the parties will review the economics of the supply relationship set forth herein. For the purpose of such review, the aggregate baseline cost of the Products will directly relate to the price per bar as set forth on Exhibit E. If the aggregate baseline cost of raw materials, packaging materials, direct labor, or variable overhead increases or decreases more than five (5) percent during the period under review, the parties agree to negotiate an appropriate price adjustment in good faith. 9. MATERIALS. (a) All ingredients and raw materials that CoPacker uses for the manufacture of the Products shall strictly conform to the Specifications. Suppliers of all other raw materials and ingredients for use in the manufacture of the Products shall be subject, at WWI's option, to the review and approval of WWI before receipt and use of raw materials and ingredients from such supplier. Such approval of CoPacker's suppliers shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such review and approval of suppliers by WWI shall be gratuitous and shall not (i) relieve CoPacker of its obligations under this Agreement, including the duty to inspect all incoming raw materials and insure that they meet the Specifications, or (ii) constitute acceptance by WWI of any raw materials, ingredients, Products, or portion thereof. 10. DELIVERY.

INSPECTIONS. Representatives of WWI may enter and inspect, as they pertain to the production of the Products, the Factory and any warehouse at which CoPacker has stored the Products, during the time of production, storage, or cleanup periods. The inspection may include all aspects of CoPacker's manufacturing techniques, quality control, sanitation procedures, and records. CoPacker may restrict access by WWI's representatives to only those areas where the Products and ingredients and materials for the Products are processed, tested, or stored. CoPacker shall maintain and make available to WWI upon request all records of chemical, physical, microbiological, and process tests of the basic ingredients and packaging materials, intermediate products, and finished Products that CoPacker conducts or that it requires from its suppliers. Any such inspection or testing by WWI shall be gratuitous and shall not (i) relieve CoPacker of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) constitute acceptance by WWI of any portion of the Products. WWI shall receive the Products subject, at WWI's discretion, to inspection and approval of the lot or lots, or submitted samples from the lots, by WWI's quality control personnel within a reasonable time after receipt. Payments by WWI for any quantity of the Products shall not constitute approval or acceptance of such Products.

The provisions of the Mutual NonDisclosure Agreement shall apply to the information that the parties exchange in the course of performance of this Agreement. (b) CoPacker acknowledges that it is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of WWI for CoPacker to enter into the following agreement respecting competition with WWI and that WWI would suffer irreparable injury if CoPacker breaches any such agreement. As a further safeguard and necessary protection for trade secret and proprietary information that WWI discloses to CoPacker, CoPacker shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in the business of producing, distributing, purchasing, or selling, or otherwise dealing in, any products, goods, or merchandise that cannot be differentiated from the Product by a large (i.e. greater than 200) sample of consumers in a blind taste evaluation, in any part of the United States, except pursuant to this Agreement.

The covenants set forth in this Section 13(b) shall remain in full force and effect during the initial term and any renewal term of this Agreement and for five years after any termination of this Agreement. 14.

If any person or entity asserts any claim or brings any suit or action against CoPacker for which WWI may be required to indemnify CoPacker under this Section 16, CoPacker promptly shall notify WWI of such claim or suit. WWI, upon receipt of such notice, shall undertake in connection with CoPacker (if CoPacker desires) the defense of such suit for the settlement of any such claim at WWI's own cost and expense. 17.
