MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT This manufacturing and supply agreement is dated 12 May, 2003, and is between NEPHROS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Nephros") and MEDICA s.r.l., an Italian company ("Medica"). Nephros sells systems it has developed for treating endstage renal disease. One component of these systems is the MD 190 hemodiafiltration cartridge (the "Cartridge"). Nephros and Medica wish for Medica to manufacture Cartridges for Nephros, using fiber provided by a supplier designated by Nephros, and ship them to purchasers designated by Nephros. The parties therefore agree as follows: Article 1 SALE AND PURCHASE 1.1 Supply of Cartridge. Subject to the terms of this agreement, Medica shall manufacture, in such quantities as Nephros orders, the Cartridge. 1.2 Nephros Exclusive Purchaser. Medica may not without the prior written consent of Nephros provide Cartridges to any Person other than Nephros. 1.3 Medica Exclusivity. Nephros shall purchase from Medica no less than * * * of the Cartridges directly marketed by Nephros in the first * * * following regulatory approval of the Cartridge in Europe ("the approval"); no less than * * * of the Cartridges directly marketed by Nephros in * * * following the approval; and no less than * * * of the Cartridges directly marketed by Nephros in * * * following the approval. Medica will also be given first consideration in good faith for the manufacture of Cartridges not directly marketed by Nephros. For purposes of this Section 1.3, Nephros will be deemed to have purchased from Medica any Cartridges that it purchases from any Person other than Medica to replace Cartridges ordered from Medica that constitute "Default Cartridges" under the terms of this agreement. Article 2 FORECASTS 2.1 Rolling Forecasts. (a) On or prior to the Forecast Initiation Date ("FID"), as specified in Schedule 3.1, Nephros shall deliver to Medica a forecast of how many Cartridges it will purchase for delivery in each of the nine consecutive months beginning one month following the FID. On or prior to one month following the FID, Nephros shall deliver to Medica a forecast of how many Cartridges it will purchase for delivery in each of the nine consecutive months beginning two months following the FID. On or prior to the first day of each subsequent month, Nephros shall deliver to Medica an update to its previously submitted forecast of its expected purchases of Cartridges (each forecast delivered pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), a "Rolling Forecast"). Each such update must consist of a repetition of the eight later months of the immediately preceding Rolling Forecast along with a forecast for the month subsequent to the last month in the previous Rolling Forecast. (b) Nephros may not revise in any subsequent Rolling Forecast the forecast for months 2 and 3 in any Rolling Forecast (month 1 being the earliest month in any Rolling Forecast). Nephros may revise in any subsequent Rolling Forecast the forecast for any other month in any Rolling Forecast. (c) The forecast for any month specified in any Rolling Forecast may not be less than the total number of Cartridges for which Nephros, prior to delivery of that Rolling Forecast to Medics in accordance with Section 2.1(a), has submitted purchase orders in accordance with Section 3.2 specifying a delivery date in that month. Article 3 ORDERS, SHIPMENT, AND PAYMENT 3.1 Price. The price paid by Nephros for any given shipment of Cartridges is as stated in Schedule 3.1. 3.2 Purchase Orders. (a) Each purchase order that Nephros places for Cartridges must be in the form attached as Exhibit A and must specify (1) how many Cartridges are desired, (2) the one or more places to which, and the manner and date by which, delivery is to be made, and (3) the applicable price per Cartridge. Nephros shall deliver all purchase orders by facsimile, or by one of the means specified in Section 14.8 for giving notice, to Medica at the following address and facsimile number or as otherwise instructed by Medics: Medica s.r.l. Via Degli Artigiani, 6 41036 Medolla (MO) Italy Attention: Daniele Giubertoni MKTG & sales Manager Facsimile: 39053552605 Email: sales@medica.it (b) Nephros shall order for delivery in any given month an aggregate number of Cartridges equal to at least 90% of the final amount forecast for that month in the Rolling Forecasts (that quantity, the "Final Forecast Quantity"). Nephros may order for delivery in any given Quarter an aggregate quantity of Cartridge not exceeding 110% of the Final Forecast Quantity. Only with Medica's written consent may Nephros order for delivery in any given Quarter an aggregate number of Cartridges exceeding 110% of the Final Forecast Quantity. 2 (c) Nephros shall deliver each purchase order for quantities of the Cartridge at least 60 days in advance of the delivery date specified in that purchase order. (d) If Nephros delivers any purchase order with less lead time than is required under Section 3.2(c), then Medica shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fill that purchase order but will not be liable to Nephros if despite those best efforts they fail to do so. (e) Medica shall acknowledge and accept in writing (by fax, email, or other means of correspondence, tbd) on behalf of Medica any purchase order that Nephros places for Cartridges. Any such purchase order will be deemed accepted by Medica if Medica does not reject it by written notice to Nephros delivered within seven Business Days of Medica's receiving that purchase order. Medica may not reject any purchase order that complies with the provisions of this Article 3. If the terms of any purchase order are inconsistent with the terms of this agreement, the terms of this agreement will control. (f) If it notifies Medica no later than 30 days prior to the date of delivery specified in any purchase order, Nephros may elect, with respect to some or all of the Cartridges ordered in that purchase order, to postpone that date of delivery to a date that is a number of days after the date of delivery specified in that purchase order equal to the number of days between the date that purchase order was delivered to Medica and the delivery date specified in that purchase order. Nephros may not further postpone delivery of any Cartridges the delivery of which was previously postponed. For purposes of determining Nephros's compliance with its obligations under Section 3.2(b), Nephros will be deemed to have purchased in the month of the original date of delivery any Cartridges the delivery of which was postponed in accordance with this Section 3.2(f). 3.3 Delivery. Each shipment of Cartridges will be delivered by Medica FOB the applicable Medica manufacturing facility or retained in Medica's warehouse facility, in accordance with Nephros instructions for each shipment. Subject to Section 3.2(f), Medica shall deliver by the delivery date specified in a purchase order all of the Cartridges specified in that purchase order. Nephros is only required to pay for Cartridges actually delivered.

For cartridges retained in the Medica warehouse, Medica shall deliver these Cartridges, FOB the warehouse, in quantities and to addresses specified in writing (by fax, email, or other means of correspondence, tbd) by Nephros, in order to fulfill individual Nephros customer orders. Medica will confirm these orders for delivery in writing (by fax, email, or other means of correspondence, tbd), and will notify Nephros upon successful delivery of the Cartridges to the customer locations specified. 3.4 Freight, Insurance, and Taxes. Nephros shall pay all freight, insurance, duties, and other fees (except tax on income to Medica) incurred in connection with sale and shipment of Cartridges under this agreement. 3.4.1 Delivery to European Community customer. Nephros will create a European business location holding a V.A.T. registration number ("Nephros Europe"). Medica 3 will invoice all deliveries for European customers to Nephros Europe, which will also provide the payment. 3.5 Delay in Delivery. If for any reason other than an Event of Force Majeure Medica delivers any shipment of Cartridges later than the date of delivery set out in the Purchase Order, Nephros will be entitled to the following as an alternative, in its sole discretion, to its rights under Section 3.6 and Section 13.2(a)(7): (1) a 5% reduction in the price of each Cartridge in the shipment if the shipment is delivered more than 14 days but less than 21 days late; (2) a 10% reduction in the price of each Cartridge in the shipment if the shipment is delivered more than 21 days late. 3.6 Delivery Default Rights. If more than 28 days have passed since the delivery date for any Cartridges and Medica has, for any reason other than an Event of Force Majeure, failed to deliver those Cartridges, then, in addition to any other remedies it might have under this agreement or by law, Nephros may cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof relating to those cartridges, as applicable, and those Cartridges will constitute Default Cartridges for purposes of Section 1.3. 3.7 Invoices and Payment Terms. On delivery by Medica of a shipment of Cartridges in accordance with Section 3.3, Medica shall issue to Nephros an invoice for that shipment stating a price consistent with the terms of this agreement. Nephros shall pay each such invoice in full within 45 Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Nephros has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2. If Nephros pays an invoice before Nephros examines the shipment as provided in Section 4.2 and thereafter determines that one or more Cartridges do not meet the Specifications, Medica shall reimburse Nephros, by wire transfer, the purchase price of the nonconforming Cartridges within 14 Calendar Days of Nephros notifying Medica of that nonconformity. Article 4 QUALITY OF THE CARTRIDGE 4.1 Conformity with Specifications. Any Cartridges that Medica manufactures under this agreement must (1) conform to the specifications in Schedule 4.1 (the "Specifications") and (2) be manufactured, labeled, packaged, stored, and tested (while in the possession of, stored by, or under the control of Medica) in accordance with cGMP. 4.2 Conditions to Rejection. In order to be entitled to reject any Cartridge, Nephros must notify Medica of any failure of the Cartridge to meet the Specifications or otherwise comply with this agreement. 4.3 Rejection. (a) Nephros may reject any Cartridge that does not meet the Specifications or otherwise comply with this agreement (any such Cartridge, a "Nonconforming Cartridge"). If Medica accepts that Nephros was entitled to reject that Cartridge, Medica shall within 14 Calendar Days after Medica receives notice under Section 4.2 replace the Nonconforming Cartridge at no additional cost to Nephros (if Nephros has paid for the 4 Nonconforming Cartridge and Medica has not reimbursed Nephros the purchase price) or for payment consistent with Section 3.7 (if Nephros has not paid for the Nonconforming Cartridge or if Medica has reimbursed Nephros the purchase price). (b) If Medica does not agree that one or more Cartridges constitute Nonconforming Cartridges, the Joint Review Committee, consisting of Quality Assurance representatives from both companies, must consider the matter. If after consideration by the Joint Review Committee the parties are unable to reach agreement within 45 Calendar Days after the date Medica received notice from Nephros under Section 4.2, they shall submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with Section 14.5. 4.4 Nonconformity Default Rights. If for any reason other than an Event of Force Majeure Medica (1) fails to replace any Nonconforming Cartridge as required by Section 4.3 or (2) fails to replace any Nonconforming Cartridge within 10 Business Days after a dispute regarding whether any rejected quantity of Cartridge constitutes Nonconforming Cartridge is decided in Nephros's favor, then, in addition to any other remedies it might have under this agreement or by law, Nephros may cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof relating to those cartridges, as applicable, and those Cartridges will constitute Default Cartridges for purposes of Section 1.3. 4.5 Acceptance of Cartridges. If Nephros does not notify Medica that one or more Cartridges do not meet the Specifications or otherwise fail to comply with this agreement, those Cartridges will be deemed to have been accepted by Nephros as being fully compliant with the Specifications and this agreement.

(a) In order to be entitled to indemnification under this Article 11 in connection with a claim made by any Person against any other Person with respect to which that other Person (an "Indemnified Party") is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 11 (any such claim, a "Third Party Claim"), that Indemnified Party must do the following: (1) notify the Person or Persons obligated to indemnify it (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of that Third Party Claim as soon as possible but in any event within 10 Business Days after receipt of notice of that Third Party Claim, except that any failure to give any such notification will only affect the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced as a result of that failure; and (2) deliver to the Indemnifying Party as soon as possible but in any event within 10 Business Days after the Indemnified Party receives a copy of all notices and documents (including court papers) delivered to that Indemnified Party relating to that Third Party Claim. (b) In the event of a Third Party Claim against one or more Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party may participate in the defense of that Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, assume at its expense the defense of that Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of that Third Party Claim, except that if, under applicable standards of professional conduct, there exists a conflict on any significant issue between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with that Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one additional counsel to act with respect to that issue to the extent necessary to resolve that conflict. If the Indemnifying Party assumes defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of that Third Party Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to control that defense. The Indemnifying Party will be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party did not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above and a reasonable period after such notice). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the parties shall cooperate in the defense 15 or prosecution of that Third Party Claim, including by retaining and providing to the Indemnifying Party records and information reasonably relevant to that Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a reasonably convenient basis. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of that Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party recommends, except that the Indemnifying Party may not without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent agree to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include as an unconditional term that each claimant or plaintiff give to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability with respect to that Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, that Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. (c) In order for any Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification under this agreement in respect of a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party must reasonably promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of that Claim, and describe in reasonable detail the basis for that Claim, except that any failure to give any such notification will only affect the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced as a result of that failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification with respect to that Claim by notice to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of a 30BusinessDay period following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of that Claim from the Indemnified Party, that Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of that liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date as the amount of the Claim (or any portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to the Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Claim and, if the Claim is not resolved through negotiations within 60 Business Days following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of that Claim from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may take the dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5. 12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Third Party Claim. This Section 12.3 does not apply to any liability of a party in respect of death or personal injury arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of that party or its agents or Representatives. 12.4 Limitation on Indemnification. (a) Each party's exclusive remedy with respect to any Claims will be under the indemnification provisions of this Article 12. (a) The liability of Medica, on the one hand, and Nephros, on the other hand, under this Article 12 will not exceed the purchase value of any quantities of the Cartridge that are the subject of any Claim or Third Party Claim. 16 Article 13 TERM AND TERMINATION 13.1 Term.
