The parties agree that for specific manufacturing orders Ligand may provide Cardinal Health with instructions that result in a yield which is lower than the agreed upon minimum yield. Cardinal Health will not have to reimburse Ligand for API to the extent that such loss is attributable to Cardinal Health's manufacturing of Product in accordance with these specific manufacturing orders.

Such artwork, advertising and packaging information or any reproduction thereof may not be used by Cardinal Health following the termination of this Agreement, or during the Term of this Agreement in any manner other than solely for the purpose of performing its obligations hereunder. 3.5 REIMBURSEMENT FOR MATERIALS. In the event of (i) a Specification change requested by Ligand or Cardinal Health for Ligand's benefit and agreed by the parties or to comply with any new requirement of a Regulatory Authority, (ii) termination by Ligand without cause or expiration of this Agreement; or (iii) unforeseeable obsolescence of any Raw Material, Ligand shall bear the cost of any unused Raw Materials which cannot be otherwise used by Cardinal Health nor returned for credit, provided that Cardinal Health purchased such Raw Materials in quantities consistent with Ligand's most recent Firm Commitment and the supplier's minimum purchase obligations. ARTICLE 4 MINIMUM COMMITMENT, PURCHASE ORDERS & FORECASTS 4.1 MINIMUM ORDERS. During each Contract Year, Ligand shall order the minimum number of units of Product ("Minimum Orders") set forth on EXHIBIT D. If Ligand does not purchase such Minimum Orders during any Contract Year, within thirty (30) days after the end of such Contract Year, Ligand shall pay Cardinal Health the difference between (i) the total amount Ligand would have paid to Cardinal Health if the Minimum Orders had been fulfilled for the Product (calculated using an average batch price as shown in EXHIBIT D) and (ii) the sum of (a) all purchases from Cardinal Health for the Product during the justconcluded Contract Year plus (b) Cardinal Health's cost of all Raw Materials for that portion of the Minimum Orders not placed. For clarity, Ligand shall not be obligated to pay for any Product ordered but not delivered by Cardinal Health in accordance with this Agreement. 4.2 FORECAST. On or before the first (1st) day of each calendar month following the Commencement Date and at least four months prior to the first Delivery Date, Ligand shall furnish to Cardinal Health a written twelve (12) month rolling forecast of the quantities of Product that Ligand intends to order from Cardinal Health during such period ("Rolling Forecast"). The first 3 months of such Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding commitment for the quantities of Product specified therein ("Firm Commitment") and the following 9 months of the Rolling Forecast shall be nonbinding, good faith estimates. 4.3 PURCHASE ORDERS. At least quarterly, Ligand shall submit purchase orders for the Firm Commitment portion of the Rolling Forecast, which specify the actual number of Batches to be Manufactured and Packaged, the approximate number of Units in each Batch, and the requested Delivery Dates for each Batch ("Purchase Order"). Ligand shall submit each Purchase Order to Cardinal Health at least one hundred and twenty (120) days in advance of the earliest Delivery Date requested in the Purchase Order. Cardinal Health will confirm such Delivery Dates within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the Purchase Order. If Cardinal Health indicates within such 15day period that it is unable to meet any such delivery date, the parties will work together in good faith to set an amended delivery date or dates. In the absence of such indication, the Delivery Date(s) shall be deemed accepted. In the event of a conflict between the terms of any Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cardinal Health shall supply Ligand with quantities of Product which exceed by not more than 25% the quantities specified in the Firm Commitment, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to supply additional excess quantities requested by Ligand. 4.5 CUSTOMER'S MODIFICATION OR CANCELLATION. (a) At any time up to 90 days prior to any relevant Delivery Date, Ligand may cancel a Purchase Order or request a modification of the confirmed Delivery Date, Specifications or quantity of Product (including e.g. quantities of dosage strengths and encapsulation quantities) in such Purchase Order by submitting a written change order ("Change Order") to Cardinal Health. If a Change Order is submitted less than 90 days prior to the relevant Delivery Date, such Change Order shall be effective and binding against Cardinal Health only upon the written approval of Cardinal Health, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ligand shall remain responsible for the Firm Commitment portion of the Rolling Forecast. (b) Notwithstanding any amounts due to Cardinal Health under Section 4.1, if Ligand fails to place Purchase Orders sufficient to satisfy the Firm Commitment, Ligand shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, pay to Cardinal Health the difference between (i) the Unit Price for all Units that would have been Manufactured and Packaged if Ligand had placed Purchase Orders sufficient to satisfy the Firm Commitment and (ii) Cardinal Health's cost of any Raw Materials that would have been used in such Units. Any amounts paid under this paragraph shall be credited against any amounts subsequently due for failure to meet Minimum Orders under paragraph 4.1. 4.6 UNPLANNED DELAY OR ELIMINATION OF MANUFACTURE OR PACKAGING. Cardinal Health shall timely fill each Purchase Order, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Cardinal Health shall notify Ligand within fifteen (15) days of receipt of any Firm Commitment or Purchase Order if Cardinal Health determines that any Manufacturing or Packaging will be delayed or eliminated for any reason, provided however that such notice shall not relieve Cardinal of any of its obligations, absent written consent of Ligand. 4.7 CUSTOMER INSPECTION. Ligand may base up to two (2) representatives at the Facilities to observe, subject to Cardinal Health's reasonable measures in furtherance of its obligations to protect the confidential information of third parties, the Manufacturing and Packaging provided that Ligand provide Cardinal Health at least ten (10) days advance written notice of the attendance of such Ligand representatives. Ligand will specify whether Ligand will observe the Manufacturing, Packaging, or both. Such inspection may include inspection for proper use and confidentiality of Ligand and Elan intellectual property. Any information received or observed by Ligand representatives shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between the parties.

If such Batch conforms to the Specifications, Ligand shall promptly, but in no event later than the end of the Review Period, provide notice of acceptance of the applicable Batch to Cardinal Health. If Ligand determines that such Batch does not conform to Specifications, Ligand shall promptly, but in no event later than the end of the Review Period, provide to Cardinal Health a notice of its determination. If Cardinal Health agrees that the Batch is defective or nonconforming, Cardinal Health will, at Ligand's option, either replace such Batch in accordance with Section 5.3 below, or credit any payments made by Ligand for such Batch. If Cardinal Health does not agree with Ligand's determination such Batch fails to meet the Specifications, then after reasonable efforts to resolve the disagreement, either party may submit a sample from the Batch to an independent third party in accordance with Section 5.2 below. If Ligand (i) notifies Cardinal Health that the Product meets the Specifications, as provided above, or (ii) does not notify Cardinal Health that Product is nonconforming prior to the end of the Review Period, then Product shall be deemed to have been accepted by Ligand, and Cardinal Health shall invoice Ligand for such Batch. 5.2 DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING PRODUCT CONFORMITY. In the event of a disagreement between the parties as to whether the Product meets the Specifications, the parties shall cause a mutually acceptable independent laboratory to review records, test data and to perform the tests and/or analyses set forth in the Specifications on samples of the alleged Defective Product. The independent laboratory's results shall be final and binding.
