(a) NOTICE. If either Party believes that the other Party is in material breach of this Supply Agreement, then the Party holding such belief (the "NONBREACHING PARTY") may deliver notice of such breach to the other Party (the "NOTIFIED PARTY"). The Notified Party shall have ninety (90) days to cure such breach, PROVIDED that, if cure cannot be reasonably effected within such ninety (90) day period, the Notified Party may elect to deliver to the Nonbreaching Party within such ninety (90) day period a plan to cure such breach within a timeframe that is reasonably prompt in light of the circumstances then prevailing, and the Nonbreaching Party shall have the right to approve or reject in writing such proposed plan in its absolute discretion. If the Nonbreaching Party approves in writing such proposed plan, then the cure period will be extended in accordance with the terms of such plan and the Notified Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to carry out such plan and cure the breach in accordance with the provisions of such plan. For purposes of evaluating whether Cubist has successfully cured a material breach of this Supply Agreement arising from a Product Shortage, quantities of Filled Product supplied by Cubist during the applicable cure period set forth above in this Section 11.4(a) shall first be allocated to the current orders during such cure period and only after Cubist has satisfied one hundred percent (100%) of the * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 28 current orders during such cure period shall any excess quantities be allocated towards curing the Product Shortage. (b) FAILURE TO CURE. If the Notified Party fails to cure such breach as provided for in Section 11.4(a) above, the Nonbreaching Party may terminate this Supply Agreement either in its entirety or with respect to one or more Filled Products upon written notice to the Notified Party, PROVIDED THAT, the Nonbreaching Party gives such written notice of termination within [*] after the Notified Party has failed to cure such breach as provided for in Section 11.4(a). (c) DISPUTES. If a Party gives notice of termination under this Section 11.4 and the other Party disputes whether such termination is proper under this Section 11.4, then the issue of whether this Supply Agreement may properly be terminated upon expiration of the notice period (unless such breach is cured as provided in Section 11.4(a) above) shall be resolved in accordance with Article 14 of the License Agreement. Both Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under the Supply Agreement and License Agreement that are not the subject of dispute while the dispute is being resolved. (d) TERMINATION AS TO CERTAIN FILLED PRODUCTS. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.4, either Party may exercise its right to terminate this Supply Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.4 with respect to one or more particular Filled Products as to which the other Party has breached its obligations under this Supply Agreement or as to which the other Party has breached its obligations under the License Agreement with respect to any Finished Products related to such Filled Products, rather than with respect to the entire Agreement, in which case the notice provided by the Nonbreaching Party pursuant to Section 11.4(a) shall specify that this Supply Agreement is being terminated pursuant to this Section 11.4 only with respect to certain Filled Products listed in such notice. If the Nonbreaching Party makes such an election under this Section 11.4(d), then subsections (a) through (c) of this Section 11.4 shall be deemed to refer to termination of this Supply Agreement only with respect to those Filled Products set forth in the notice provided pursuant to Section 11.4(a). (e) TERMINATION AS TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.4, in the event that Cubist materially breaches any of its obligations under this Supply Agreement and such material breach is the effective cause for Chiron not being able to obtain or maintain Regulatory Approval to sell a Finished Product in one or more countries in the Territory, Chiron may exercise its right to terminate, pursuant to this Section 11.4, this Supply Agreement only with respect to such country or countries in the Territory, rather than with respect to all countries in the Territory, in which case the notice provided by Chiron pursuant to Section 11.4(a) shall specify that this Supply Agreement is being terminated pursuant to this Section 11.4 only with respect to those of such countries that are listed in such notice and with respect to such Finished Product. If Chiron makes such an election under this Section 11.4(e), then subsections (a) through (d) of this Section 11.4 shall be deemed to refer to termination of this Supply Agreement only with respect to those of such countries that are listed in the notice provided pursuant to Section 11.4(a). * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 29 11.5. EFFECT OF TERMINATION; SURVIVAL. Upon expiration or termination of this Supply Agreement for any reason, the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Supply Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect whatsoever; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) the expiration or termination of this Supply Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability, obligation or agreement that already had accrued prior to the effective date of expiration or termination, including (i) Cubist's obligation to deliver in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 hereof any units of Filled Product covered by any binding forecast delivered by Chiron in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 hereof prior to the effective date of such expiration or termination, or (ii) Chiron's obligation to accept in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 hereof and, upon acceptance, to pay for any such units of Filled Product, and (B) the expiration or termination of this Supply Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability, obligation or agreement that survives such expiration or termination pursuant to the next sentence of this Section 11.5. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, the provisions of Articles 1, 7, 10 and 12, Sections 6.6(b), 9.1, 9.2 and 11.6, and this Section 11.5 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Supply Agreement. The provisions of Articles 5 and 8 and Section 3.4 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Supply Agreement to the extent applicable to binding Purchase Orders that are outstanding at the time of such expiration or termination. 11.6 BACKUP SUPPLY RIGHTS OF CHIRON. (a) PRODUCT SHORTAGE. In the event that (i) Chiron terminates this Supply Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 11.4 due to a material breach by Cubist of its obligation to supply Filled Products to Chiron pursuant to this Supply Agreement, (ii) such failure to supply meets the criteria of a Product Shortage, (iii) such failure to supply by Cubist was or is not due to the occurrence of a Force Majeure, and (iv) such material breach is not cured in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.4(a) of this Supply Agreement within the applicable cure period, then Chiron shall be entitled to exercise its rights under this Section 11.6, PROVIDED that, prior to exercising such rights, Chiron shall have given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice (the "SECTION 11.6 NOTICE") to Cubist that Chiron intends to exercise its backup supply rights under this Section 11.6. Chiron shall have given the Section 11.6 Notice not later than [*] after the end of the cure period to remedy the Product Shortage that gave rise to such material breach. (b) INABILITY TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL. In the event that (i) Cubist materially breaches any of its obligations under this Supply Agreement, (ii) such material breach is the effective cause for Chiron not being able to obtain or maintain Regulatory Approval to sell Finished Products in one or more countries in the Territory, and (iii) Chiron terminates this Supply Agreement pursuant to Section 11.4(e) only with respect to such country or countries but not all of the countries in the Territory, then Chiron shall be entitled to exercise its rights under Section 11.6(c), PROVIDED that, prior to exercising such rights, Chiron shall have given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Cubist that Chiron intends to exercise its backup supply rights under Section 11.6(c) and identifies the country or countries within the Territory as to which Chiron intents to exercise such backup supply rights. * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 30 (c) CUBIST SUPPLIERS. From and after the date upon which Chiron exercises its backup supply rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(a) or Section 11.6(b), as the case may be, Chiron shall be free to deal directly with the Cubist Suppliers to obtain quantities of API and Filled Product from the Cubist Suppliers that (x) in the case of the exercise of backup supply rights pursuant to Section 11.6(a), are sufficient to satisfy Chiron's requirements of Finished Products for sale in the Territory, and (y) in the case of the exercise of backup supply rights pursuant to Section 11.6(b), are sufficient to satisfy Chiron's requirement of Finished Products for sale in the country or countries within the Territory as to which Chiron exercised such backup supply rights. At the request of Chiron, Cubist shall provide such cooperation and assistance as Chiron shall reasonably request in connection with the establishment by Chiron of a direct relationship with the Cubist Suppliers. Cubist shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Cubist in connection with the rendering of such cooperation and assistance. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.6(c) while authorizing both Chiron and Cubist Suppliers to freely engage in negotiations for the supply of API and Filled Product from a finite capacity of the Cubist Suppliers to manufacture and supply same, shall not by itself be construed to authorize Chiron to interfere PER SE with Cubist's existing contracts with its suppliers, it being understood and acknowledged by Cubist that any given point in time there is a finite capacity of the Cubist Suppliers to manufacture and supply API and Filled Product, and Chiron, under the circumstances of negotiating with the Cubist Suppliers for manufacture and supply of API and Filled Product for Chiron's requirements, may compete with Cubist for the use of such finite capacity. (d) ALTERNATE MANUFACTURING SOURCE. At any time from and after the date upon which Chiron exercises its backup supply rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(a) (but not its backup supply rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(b)), Chiron shall be free to establish a manufacturing source for API and/or Filled Product that is not a Cubist Supplier. Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below in this Section 11.6(d), Section 11.6(e) and Section 11.6(f), at the request of Chiron, Cubist shall provide such cooperation and assistance, and shall request that the Cubist Suppliers provide such cooperation and assistance, to Chiron as Chiron shall reasonably request in connection with the establishment by Chiron of any such alternate manufacturing source. Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below in this Section 11.6(d), Section 11.6(e) and Section 11.6(f) below, such cooperation and assistance may include reasonable assistance to enable or facilitate the preparation and maintenance by Chiron or its alternate manufacturing source of licenses, registrations, permits, qualifications and approvals from the relevant Regulatory Authorities so that such alternate supplier shall have satisfied all legal and regulatory requirements necessary to commence manufacture and supply of Filled Products to Chiron for sale in the Territory. Cubist shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Cubist and/or the Cubist Suppliers in connection with rendering such cooperation and assistance. In no event shall Cubist be required to do anything, or to cause, direct or request the Cubist Suppliers to do anything, pursuant to this Section 11.6(d) that would disadvantage, diminish or impair Cubist's ability to obtain or maintain continuous and uninterrupted supply of Finished Product for sale by Cubist or its Affiliates, Other Licensees or distributors outside the Territory. * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 31 (e) TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. Subject to the provisions of this Section 11.6(e), at the request of Chiron, Cubist shall transfer directly to the alternate manufacturing source designated by Chiron any and all Cubist KnowHow or other Information with respect to the manufacture of Filled Products, PROVIDED that such alternate manufacturing source shall have entered into a nondisclosure agreement with Cubist in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Cubist for purposes of appropriately and reasonably protecting the confidentiality and restricting the use of any such Cubist KnowHow or other Information to be transferred by Cubist. (f) REGULATORY FILINGS. To the extent that Chiron or any alternate manufacturing source designated by Chiron pursuant to Section 11.6(d) needs to submit and make available to Regulatory Authorities in the Territory any Cubist KnowHow or other Information concerning the manufacturing of API, Filled Products and/or Finished Products by any such alternate manufacturing source, the Parties agree that, to the fullest extent possible, such Cubist KnowHow or other Information shall be made available to the applicable Regulatory Authorities in the Territory via a Drug Master File to be established by Cubist or any such alternate manufacturing source and that Chiron shall not have access to the Information in such Drug Master File. The applicable Regulatory Authorities in the Territory shall have full access to all of the Information in such Drug Master File to the extent necessary for such applicable Regulatory Authorities to consider and act upon the qualification of any such alternate manufacturing source or to consider and act upon any filings for Regulatory Approvals in the Territory that are submitted by Chiron, and Chiron shall have the right to reference all of the Cubist KnowHow and Information in such Drug Master File to the extent necessary to file applications for Regulatory Approvals of Finished Products in the Territory and to obtain such Regulatory Approvals. If and to the extent that Chiron needs to submit and make available any Cubist KnowHow or other Information concerning the manufacturing of API, Filled Products and/or Finished Products in connection with any submission by Chiron of any application for Regulatory Approvals of Finished Products within the Territory and the applicable regulatory requirements shall not permit the submission of such Cubist KnowHow or other Information via a Drug Master File, then the Parties agree that such Cubist KnowHow and other Information shall be made available to Chiron for the sole purpose of filing applications for Regulatory Approvals of Finished Products in the Territory and obtaining such Regulatory Approvals, and that Chiron shall not be entitled to use such Cubist KnowHow or other Information for any other purpose whatsoever other than to manufacture or have manufactured API, Filled Products and/or Finished Products. Any Cubist KnowHow or other Information pertaining to the manufacturing of API, Filled Products and/or Finished Products, as the case may be, that is made available to Chiron pursuant to this Section 11.6(f) shall be treated for all purposes of this Supply Agreement as Confidential Information of Cubist and shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations under Section 12.1 hereof (which Section incorporates by reference the confidentiality obligations of Article 13 of the License Agreement and makes them applicable to this Supply Agreement). (g) MANUFACTURING COSTS. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Supply Agreement or the License Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time that Chiron exercises its backup supply rights in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.6, * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 32 Chiron shall be entitled, subject to the provisions set forth below in this Section 11.6(g) and Section 11.6(h), to offset Chiron's Manufacturing Cost for units of Filled Product against any royalties payable by Chiron to Cubist under the License Agreement from sales in the Territory of Licensed Product consisting of such units of such Filled Product. Chiron's Manufacturing Costs shall be determined in accordance with the following subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 11.6(g): (i) BACKUP SUPPLY FOR FILLING AND FINISHING ONLY. If Chiron exercises its backup supply rights under this Section 11.6 with respect to Filled Product but not API and in the event that Cubist continues to supply API to Chiron pursuant to this Supply Agreement at Cubist's Manufacturing Cost for such API, then, for purposes of this Section 11.6(g) and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.1(b) to the contrary, Chiron's Manufacturing Cost for Filled Product shall consist of (i) the transfer price payable by Chiron to Cubist in connection with supply of API and (ii) Chiron's Manufacturing Cost attributable only to filling and finishing units of Filled Product up to an amount equal to [*] of the portion of Cubist's Manufacturing Cost immediately prior to the exercise by Chiron of its backup supply rights pursuant to this Section 11.6 that is attributable to filling and finishing units of Filled Product. (ii) BACKUP SUPPLY FOR BOTH API AND FILLED PRODUCT. If Chiron exercises its backup supply rights under this Section 11.6 with respect to both API and Filled Product, then, for purposes of this Section 11.6(g) and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.1(b) to the contrary, Chiron's Manufacturing Cost for Filled Product shall be no greater than an amount equal to [*] of the Transfer Price in effect immediately prior to the exercise by Chiron of its backup supply rights pursuant to this Section 11.6. (iii) CUBIST ABLE TO SUPPLY. In the event that, at any time and from time to time after Chiron exercises its backup supply rights pursuant to this Section 11.6, Cubist is ready, willing and able to supply Filled Products to Chiron and Chiron is, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6(h) below, able to consider reestablishing a supply relationship with Cubist, then, for purposes of this Section 11.6(g) and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.1(b) or in the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.6(g) to the contrary, Chiron's Manufacturing Cost for Filled Product shall be an amount per unit of Filled Product no greater [*] at which Cubist would be prepared at the time of such quote to supply units of Filled Product to Chiron. Subject to Section 11.6(h), any offset pursuant to this Section 11.6(g) of Chiron's Manufacturing Cost for units of Filled Product against any royalties payable by Chiron to * CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED: MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED WITH THE COMMISSION 33 Cubist under the License Agreement for sales in the Territory of Licensed Product consisting of such units of such Filled Product shall be in lieu of offsetting against such royalties, as contemplated under the License Agreement, the Transfer Price that Chiron would have paid to Cubist if Cubist had supplied such units of Filled Product pursuant to this Supply Agreement. In the event that the amount of royalties due from Chiron to Cubist pursuant to the License Agreement for sales in the Territory of units of Licensed Product is less than the aggregate Chiron Manufacturing Cost incurred by Chiron with respect to such units, Cubist shall not be liable or responsible for, or owe Chiron any monies as a result of, such deficiency. (h) RESUPPLY BY CUBIST. In the event that Chiron exercises its backup supply rights in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.6, Chiron shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to minimize the length of time that it is contractually obligated to source API and/or Filled Product from a supplier other than Cubist and to minimize the applicable transfer price that Chiron agrees to pay to such supplier other than Cubist in connection with API and/or units of Filled Product supplied by such supplier. In the event that Chiron is at or near the end of the terms of the contracts for supply of Licensed Product with Third Parties (subsequent to having exercised its backup supply rights herein) or in the event that, prior to the end of the term of any such contracts, Chiron is no longer contractually obligated to source all or any portion of Chiron's requirements for API and/or any Filled Product under any such contracts, then Chiron will notify Cubist thereof and thereafter, Cubist, to the extent that it remains so interested, shall be included among the interested contract manufacturers and suppliers with whom Chiron holds discussions for the supply of all or any portion of Chiron's requirements for API and/or such Filled Product. Cubist acknowledges that, subject to the provisions of Section 11.6(g) above, beyond inclusion and participation in the discussions for such rights, Cubist has no additional right or expectation whatsoever, and Chiron has no additional obligation to Cubist in respect of such conegotiation rights. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Cubist acknowledges that Chiron shall have complete liberty to select its manufacturer and supplier for API and/or Filled Product as Chiron sees fit.
