Until such time as the Equipment is returned and delivered to Lessor or its designee and accepted by Lessor, Lessee shall, at its sole expense, procure and maintain in force at all times (a) insurance naming Lessor as an additional insured, protecting against liability for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the ownership, installation, functioning, operation, presence, use or possession of the Equipment or any part thereof, in such amounts as shall be reasonably acceptable to Lessor, and (b) insurance against loss, theft, damage or destruction of the Equipment from any cause, and against such other risks, including flood, as Lessor may direct, in an amount not less than the aggregate amount of the total rental payments due hereunder for the Term or for the Lessor's full list price of the Equipment, whichever amount is greater, with loss payable to Lessor or its assignee as their interests may appear, and with such insurance companies as Lessor shall reasonably approve. Payments made by Lessee pursuant to this Clause 9 hereof may not be charged as a cost of Lessee in accordance with Section 3.2(b) of the Manufacturing Agreement. All policies shall provide that they cannot be amended without the consent of Lessor or its assignees. All policies and endorsements, or certificates thereof, shall be promptly furnished to Lessor. At least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then current policy term, renewal policies and 3 endorsements, or certificates thereof, shall be provided to Lessor. Each insurer shall agree in writing to give Lessor or its assignee thirty (30) days prior written notice of the effective date of any alteration or cancellation of such policy. In the event Lessee fails to procure or maintain said insurance as hereinbefore specified, Lessor shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to effect such insurance. In that event, the cost thereof shall be repayable to Lessor with the next rental payment due, and failure to repay the same shall carry with it the same consequence as failure to pay any rental payment. B. Lessee shall bear the entire risk of loss, theft, damage or destruction of the Equipment from any cause whatsoever, and no loss, theft, damage or destruction of the Equipment shall relieve Lessee of the obligation to pay rental payments or any other obligation under this Lease. If any item of Equipment should be damaged by reason of any cause, and be capable of repair, Lessee shall repair the same at Lessee's sole expense as quickly as circumstances permit without any abatement or reduction of rental payments. In such event, should Lessor be indemnified under any insurance policy or policies pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, provided that no default by Lessee exists hereunder, Lessor shall pay to Lessee the proceeds received by Lessor from such insurance to assist Lessee in defraying the cost and expense of such repair. If any item of Equipment should be lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged beyond repair by any cause whatsoever, Lessee shall pay Lessor an amount equal to the full list price of the Equipment less depreciation and the amount of any insurance received by Lessor. C. Lessee shall immediately give notice to Lessor of any damage to any of the Equipment constituting or which might constitute an event of loss under the applicable insurance policies. D. Lessee shall indemnify and save Lessor and its assignee, if any, harmless from all claims, liability, injury, loss and damage of any kind (including claims for strict liability in tort) and any costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys' fees) asserted by Lessee or others arising from or allegedly caused by the installation, presence, use, possession, selection, leasing, renting, operation, control, maintenance, delivery and return of the Equipment, or ownership of any of the Equipment and from loss of any kind, however caused, arising from the malfunctioning or destruction of the Equipment, and such indemnity shall survive termination of this Lease for any reason. Insurance costs incurred by Lessee to insure Lessee for the risks relevant to this Clause 9(D) may not be charged as a cost of Lessee in accordance with Section 3.2(b) of the Manufacturing Agreement. 10. ASSIGNMENT; NO SETOFF AGAINST ASSIGNEE. Lessor shall have the right to assign all or any part of its rights under this Lease without notice to Lessee, but such assignment shall not relieve Lessor in any manner whatsoever of Lessor's obligations hereunder. In such event, Lessor's assignee shall be entitled to enforce 4 the rights assigned but shall be under no liability to Lessee to perform any of the obligations of Lessor hereunder (except for the application of any insurance proceeds received by the assignee as provided for herein), and Lessee's rights hereunder as against Lessor shall be unaffected, except as herein specifically provided. Lessee agrees that following its receipt of notice of any assignment by Lessor of this Lease or of the rental payments payable hereunder, it will pay the rental payments due hereunder directly to the assignee (or to whomever the assignee shall designate), notwithstanding (a) any agreements or amendments hereto now or hereafter entered into by Lessor with Lessee, (b) the commencement by or against Lessor of any proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or the appointment therein of any trustee or receiver or similar officer to take custody of Lessor's estate or the making by Lessor of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (c) the availability of any claim, demand, defense (other than payment), setoff, counterclaim or recoupment which Lessee may have against Lessor other than arising out of (x) any breach of any obligation of Lessor in respect of the Equipment, or (y) by reason of any other indebtedness or liability at any time owing to Lessee by Lessor. Any assignee of Lessor's rights may reassign such rights with the same force and effect as an original assignment. Lessee will not modify or consent to any modification of the terms of this Lease, assign this Lease, or sublet or move any item of Equipment without the prior written consent of Lessor and its assignee, if any. 11. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES. A. If (a) Lessee shall fail to pay any rental payment or any other payment hereunder within five (5) days after the date when such obligation is due; or (b) Lessee shall fail to perform any other term or condition of this Lease for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Lessor to Lessee; or (c) proceedings under United States or other national or local bankruptcy law or other insolvency laws shall be instituted against Lessee, or a trustee or receiver or similar officer shall be appointed for Lessee or any of its property, or any of the Equipment shall be attached or levied upon and such proceedings shall not be vacated or fully stayed within fifteen (15) days thereof; or (d) Lessee shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or institute proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due; or (e) Lessee attempts to remove, sell, transfer, encumber, sublet or part with possession of the Equipment, or assigns or attempts to assign all or any part of this Lease or Lessee's rights hereunder; or (f) Lessee ceases doing business as a going concern, sells substantially all of its assets out of the ordinary course of business, merges or consolidates with any other person, or, if a corporation, sustains a change in the ownership of more than 20% in the aggregate of its issued and outstanding stock of any class except a change of ownership as a result of (x) a transfer to an Affiliate (as defined in the Manufacturing Agreement) or (y) a bona fide reorganization, or abandons any or all of the Equipment; or (g) Lessee is a corporation and ceases its corporate existence or good standing; or (h) Lessee has made any material misrepresentation (including the failure to disclose a material fact) under this Lease or in connection with any credit or other information submitted or furnished to Lessor, or breached 5 any warranties made by it under this Lease; or (i) any adverse change in the financial condition of Lessee or any surety or guarantor shall occur; then, in any such event, the Lessee shall be deemed to have breached this Lease and shall be in default hereunder. B. Upon the happening of any event of default, the Lessor shall have the right to do any of the following without demand or notice of any kind: (a) declare the balance of the rental payments and all other sums due and payable to Lessor and to become due hereunder immediately due and payable forthwith, and Lessor shall have the right to take immediate possession of the Equipment, and to lease or sell, or both, the Equipment or any portion thereof, upon such terms as Lessor may elect and to apply the net proceeds, less reasonable selling and administrative expenses, on account of Lessee's obligations hereunder; or (b) terminate this Lease as to any and all Equipment, and take immediate possession of the Equipment as aforesaid, and retain the same as Lessor's sole property, in full satisfaction of Lessee's obligations hereunder and as liquidated damages for Lessee's breach; or (c) exercise any other right or remedy which may be available to Lessor under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law including, without limitation, the right to recover damages for breach hereof. C. Lessor shall have no obligation to exercise any such remedy, and the exercise of any thereof shall not release Lessee from its obligations hereunder. In addition, all of Lessor's remedies shall be cumulative, and action on one shall not be deemed to constitute an election or waiver of any other right to which Lessor may be entitled. D. In addition to all of the foregoing, in the event of default, Lessee shall pay Lessor's reasonable attorneys' fees, together with an amount equal to all expenses paid or incurred by Lessor in the enforcement of any of Lessor's rights or privileges hereunder. 12. GENERAL. A. PERSONAL PROPERTY. This Lease is a contract of lease only, and nothing herein shall be construed as conveying to Lessee any right, title or interest in or to any of the Equipment except its rights as a Lessee only. The Equipment is and shall be and shall at all times remain personal property irrespective of its use or the manner in which it may be attached to real property. Lessee agrees to procure for Lessor such estoppel certificates, landlord's and mortgagee's waivers or other similar documents as Lessor may reasonably request. Lessee, at the request of Lessor, shall execute, and pay any filing and recording fees relating to, financing statements or other documents or instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code or similar statutes which Lessor may deem necessary to evidence or protect its interest in the Equipment or in this Lease (such fees and related costs incurred by Lessee may not be charged as a cost of Lessee in accordance with Section 3.2(b) of the Manufacturing Agreement), and Lessee hereby appoints Lessor or its assignee and any officer of Lessor or its assignee as Lessee's attorney in fact and authorizes Lessor or such assignee or such officer to execute and file any such statement, document or instrument for and on behalf of Lessee. 6 B. PERFORMANCE. If Lessee fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, Lessor may, but shall not be required to, perform the same. The costs of such performance and the amount of any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred by Lessor in so doing shall be added to the next or any subsequent rental payment due hereunder and shall be paid by Lessee in accordance with Section 4 hereof. C. EXONERATION FOR ENTERING PREMISES. In the event that it shall be necessary for Lessor or its designee to enter upon premises owned or leased by Lessee to inspect the Equipment, to perform any obligations of Lessee or to recover possession of the Equipment, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Lessor or such designee may do so without court order or other process of law and shall not be liable to Lessee for any damage arising out of such entry and performance or repossession, except for damages caused by Lessor's gross negligence or willful misconduct. D. NOTICES. Any notice, consent, waiver or other communication (except invoices and requests for documents) given hereunder by either party shall be in writing and mailed, postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested, to the other party at the address set forth herein or to such other address as such party shall hereafter designate by notice in writing to the other party. E. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT BY LESSEE. This Lease shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns; provided, however, that Lessee may not assign this Lease or any of Lessee's rights hereunder or sublease any of the Equipment or permit others to use the Equipment without the prior written consent of Lessor. Any assignment or sublease effected by Lessee without such consent shall be void and shall not relieve Lessee of any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder nor confer any rights upon the intended assignee.

The headings and subheadings of the various sections of this Agreement are inserted merely for the purpose of convenience and do not expressly or by implication limit, define or extend the specific terms of the section so designated.

H. SEVERABILITY.

I. DELAY AND NONWAIVER. No delay or omission by Lessor to exercise any remedy or right accruing upon a default shall impair any such remedy or right, nor be construed to be 7 a waiver of any such default or any other default, nor an acquiescence therein, nor a waiver of or in any manner affect Lessor's right not to waive any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature. J. ARBITRATION. In the event of any dispute arising out of the terms of this agreement the parties shall attempt to reach an amicable settlement. Failing such settlement the dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in effect at the time of arbitration, by one or more arbitrators designated in conformity with these rules, the awards being formal and binding.
